.SH NAME
.PP
\&spd \- ScPrime Daemon


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
spd version
.br
spd modules
.br
spd [OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The ScPrime daemon, spd, is a background process that does all of the heavy lifting for ScPrime. The daemon downloads the blockchain, uploads files, manages redundancy, monitors hosts for uptime, to name a few of the many tasks that it performs.
The daemon is composed of modules, and each modules provides a set of primary functions on the network.


.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB\-\-agent\fP="ScPrime\-Agent"
    required substring for the user agent

.PP
\fB\-\-api\-addr\fP="localhost:4280"
    which host:port the API server listens on

.PP
\fB\-\-authenticate\-api\fP[=false]
    enable API password protection

.PP
\fB\-\-disable\-api\-security\fP[=false]
    allow spd to listen on a non\-localhost address (DANGEROUS)

.PP
\fB\-\-host\-addr\fP=":4282"
    which port the host listens on

.PP
\fB\-M\fP, \fB\-\-modules\fP="cghrtw"
.IP
Use the -M or --modules flag to only run specific modules. Modules are
independent components of ScPrime. This flag should only be used by developers or
people who want to reduce overhead from unused modules. Modules are specified by
their first letter. If the -M or --modules flag is not specified the default
.br 
modules are run. The default modules are:
.br
gateway, consensus set, host, miner, renter, transaction pool, wallet
.br
This is equivalent to:
.br
	spd -M cghmrtw
.br
Below is a list of all the modules available.
.IP
\fBGateway (g):\fP
.br
The gateway maintains a peer to peer connection to the network and
enables other modules to perform RPC calls on peers.
The gateway is required by all other modules.
.br
Example: spd -M g
.IP
\fBConsensus Set (c):\fP
.br
The consensus set manages everything related to consensus and keeps the
blockchain in sync with the rest of the network.
The consensus set requires the gateway.
.br
Example:spd -M gc
.IP
\fBTransaction Pool (t):\fP
.br
The transaction pool manages unconfirmed transactions.
The transaction pool requires the consensus set.
.br
Example:spd -M gct
.IP
\fBWallet (w):\fP
.br
The wallet stores and manages siaprimecoins and siaprimefunds.
The wallet requires the consensus set and transaction pool.
.br
Example: spd -M gctw
.IP
\fBRenter (r):\fP
.br
The renter manages the user's files on the network.
The renter requires the consensus set, transaction pool, and wallet.
.br
Example: spd -M gctwr
.IP
\fBHost (h):\fP
.br
The host provides storage from local disks to the network. The host
negotiates file contracts with remote renters to earn money for storing
other users' files.
The host requires the consensus set, transaction pool, and wallet.
.br
Example: spd -M gctwh
.IP
\fBMiner (m):\fP
.br
The miner provides a basic CPU mining implementation as well as an API
for external miners to use.
The miner requires the consensus set, transaction pool, and wallet.
.br
Example: spd -M gctwm
.IP
\fBExplorer (e):\fP
.br
The explorer provides statistics about the blockchain and can be
queried for information about specific transactions or other objects on
the blockchain.
The explorer requires the consenus set.
.br
Example: spd -M gce


.PP
\fB\-\-no\-bootstrap\fP[=false]
    disable bootstrapping on this run

.PP
\fB\-\-profile\fP[=false]
    enable profiling

.PP
\fB\-\-profile\-directory\fP="profiles"
    location of the profiling directory

.PP
\fB\-\-rpc\-addr\fP=":4281"
    which port the gateway listens on

.PP
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-siaprime\-directory\fP=""
    location of the sia directory
