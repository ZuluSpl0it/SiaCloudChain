# Introduction

## Welcome to the Sia Storage Platform API!
> Example GET curl call 

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:9980/wallet/transactions?startheight=1&endheight=250"
```

> Example POST curl call with data

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "amount=123&destination=abcd" "localhost:9980/wallet/siacoins"
```

> Example POST curl call without data or authentication

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -X POST "localhost:9980/gateway/connect/123.456.789.0:9981"
```

Sia uses semantic versioning and is backwards compatible to version v1.0.0.

API calls return either JSON or no content. Success is indicated by 2xx HTTP status codes, while errors are indicated by 4xx and 5xx HTTP status codes. If an endpoint does not specify its expected status code refer to [standard responses](#Standard-Responses).

There may be functional API calls which are not documented. These are not guaranteed to be supported beyond the current release, and should not be used in production.

**Notes:**

- Requests must set their User-Agent string to contain the substring "Sia-Agent".
- By default, siad listens on "localhost:9980". This can be changed using the `--api-addr` flag when running siad.
- **Do not bind or expose the API to a non-loopback address unless you are aware of the possible dangers.**

## Documentation Standards

The following details the documentation standards for the API endpoints.
 - Endpoints should follow the structure of:
    - Parameters
    - Response
 - Each endpoint should have a corresponding curl example
 - All non-standard responses should have a JSON Response example
  with units
 - There should be detailed descriptions of all JSON response fields
 - There should be detailed descriptions of all query string parameters
 - Query String Parameters should be separated into **REQUIRED** and **OPTIONAL** sections
 - Detailed descriptions should be structured as "**field** | units"

Contributors should follow these standards when submitting updates to the API documentation.  If you find API endpoints that do not adhere to these documentation standards please let the Sia team know by submitting an issue [here](https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues)

# Standard Responses

## Success
The standard response indicating the request was successfully processed is HTTP status code `204 No Content`. If the request was successfully processed and the server responded with JSON the HTTP status code is `200 OK`. Specific endpoints may specify other 2xx status codes on success.

## Error

```go
{
    "message": String

    // There may be additional fields depending on the specific error.
}
```

The standard error response indicating the request failed for any reason, is a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status code with an error JSON object describing the error.

# Authentication
> Example POST curl call with Authentication

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" --user "":<apipassword> --data "amount=123&destination=abcd" "localhost:9980/wallet/siacoins"
```

API authentication is enabled by default, using a password stored in a flat file. The location of this file is:

 - Linux:   `$HOME/.sia/apipassword`
 - MacOS:   `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Sia/apipassword`
 - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Sia\apipassword`


Note that the file contains a trailing newline, which must be trimmed before
use.

Authentication is HTTP Basic Authentication as described in [RFC 2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617), however, the username is the empty string. The flag does not enforce authentication on all API endpoints. Only endpoints that expose sensitive information or modify state require authentication.

For example, if the API password is "foobar" the request header should include

`Authorization: Basic OmZvb2Jhcg==`

And for a curl call the following would be included

`--user "":<apipassword>`

Authentication can be disabled by passing the `--authenticate-api=false` flag to siad. You can change the password by modifying the password file, setting the `SIA_API_PASSWORD` environment variable, or passing the `--temp-password` flag to siad.

# Units

Unless otherwise noted, all parameters should be identified in their smallest possible unit. For example, size should always be specified in bytes and Siacoins should always be specified in hastings. JSON values returned by the API will also use the smallest possible unit, unless otherwise noted.

If a number is returned as a string in JSON, it should be treated as an arbitrary-precision number (bignum), and it should be parsed with your language's corresponding bignum library. Currency values are the most common example where this is necessary.

# Consensus

The consensus set manages everything related to consensus and keeps the blockchain in sync with the rest of the network. The consensus set's API endpoint returns information about the state of the blockchain.

## /consensus [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" "localhost:9980/consensus"
```

Returns information about the consensus set, such as the current block height.
Also returns the set of constants in use in the consensus code.

```
**blockfrequency** | blockheight  
BlockFrequency is the desired number of seconds that should elapse, on average, between successive Blocks.

**blocksizelimit** | uint64  
BlockSizeLimit is the maximum size of a binary-encoded Block that is permitted by the consensus rules.

**extremefuturethreshold** | timestamp  
ExtremeFutureThreshold is a temporal limit beyond which Blocks are discarded by the consensus rules. When incoming Blocks are processed, their Timestamp is allowed to exceed the processor's current time by a small amount. But if the Timestamp is further into the future than ExtremeFutureThreshold, the Block is immediately discarded.

**futurethreshold** | timestamp  
FutureThreshold is a temporal limit beyond which Blocks are discarded by the consensus rules. When incoming Blocks are processed, their Timestamp is allowed to exceed the processor's current time by no more than FutureThreshold. If the excess duration is larger than FutureThreshold, but smaller than ExtremeFutureThreshold, the Block may be held in memory until the Block's Timestamp exceeds the current time by less than FutureThreshold.

**genesistimestamp** | timestamp  
GenesisBlock is the first block of the block chain

**maturitydelay** | blockheight  
MaturityDelay specifies the number of blocks that a maturity-required output is required to be on hold before it can be spent on the blockchain. Outputs are maturity-required if they are highly likely to be altered or invalidated in the event of a small reorg. One example is the block reward, as a small reorg may invalidate the block reward. Another example is a siafund payout, as a tiny reorg may change the value of the payout, and thus invalidate any transactions spending the payout. File contract payouts also are subject to a maturity delay.

**mediantimestampwindow** | uint64  
MedianTimestampWindow tells us how many blocks to look back when calculating the median timestamp over the previous n blocks. The timestamp of a block is not allowed to be less than or equal to the median timestamp of the previous n blocks, where for Sia this number is typically 11.

**siafundcount** | currency  
SiafundCount is the total number of Siafunds in existence.

**siafundportion** | big.Rat  
SiafundPortion is the percentage of siacoins that is taxed from FileContracts.

**targetwindow** | blockheight  
TargetWindow is the number of blocks to look backwards when determining how much time has passed vs. how many blocks have been created. It's only used in the old, broken difficulty adjustment algorithm.

**initialcoinbase** | uint64  
InitialCoinbase is the coinbase reward of the Genesis block.

**minimumcoinbase** | uint64  
MinimumCoinbase is the minimum coinbase reward for a block. The coinbase decreases in each block after the Genesis block, but it will not decrease past MinimumCoinbase.

**roottarget** | target  
RootTarget is the target for the genesis block - basically how much work needs to be done in order to mine the first block. The difficulty adjustment algorithm takes over from there.

**rootdepth** | target  
RootDepth is the cumulative target of all blocks. The root depth is essentially the maximum possible target, there have been no blocks yet, so there is no cumulated difficulty yet.

**defaultallowance** | allowance  
DefaultAllowance is the set of default allowance settings that will be used when allowances are not set or not fully set

**maxtargetadjustmentup** | big.Rat  
MaxTargetAdjustmentUp restrict how much the block difficulty is allowed to change in a single step, which is important to limit the effect of difficulty raising and lowering attacks.

**maxtargetadjustmentdown** | big.Rat  
MaxTargetAdjustmentDown restrict how much the block difficulty is allowed to change in a single step, which is important to limit the effect of difficulty raising and lowering attacks.

**siacoinprecision** | currency  
SiacoinPrecision is the number of base units in a siacoin. The Sia network has a very large number of base units. We call 10^24 of these a siacoin.

```
```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data '{"action":"set","addresses":[]}' "localhost:9980/gateway/blacklist"
```

performs actions on the Gateway's blacklist. There are three `actions` that can be performed. `append` and `remove` are used for appending or removing addresses from the Gateway's blacklist. `set` is used to define all the addresses in the blacklist. If a list of addresses is provided with `set`, that list of addresses will become the Gateway's blacklist, replacing any blacklist that was currently in place. To clear the Gateway's blacklist, submit an empty list with `set`.

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**action** | string  
this is the action to be performed on the blacklist. Allowed inputs are `append`, `remove`, and `set`.

**addresses** | string  
this is a comma separated list of addresses that are to be appended to or removed from the blacklist. If the action is `append` or `remove` this field is required.

### Response
standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

#### externalsettings  
The settings that get displayed to untrusted nodes querying the host's status.  
  
**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
Whether or not the host is accepting new contracts.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single download request from a renter. Each download request has multiple round trips of communication that exchange money. Larger batch sizes mean fewer round trips, but more financial risk for the host - the renter can get a free batch when downloading by refusing to provide a signature.  

**maxduration** | blocks  
The maximum duration that a host will allow for a file contract. The host commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete. The storage proof window of an incoming file contract must end before the current height + maxduration.  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single batch of file contract revisions. The renter can perform DoS attacks on the host by uploading a batch of data then refusing to provide a signature to pay for the data. The host can reduce this exposure by limiting the batch size. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
**netaddress** | string
=======
**netaddress** | string  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
The IP address or hostname (including port) that the host should be contacted at.  

**remainingstorage** | bytes  
The amount of unused storage capacity on the host in bytes. It should be noted that the host can lie.  

**sectorsize** | bytes  
The smallest amount of data in bytes that can be uploaded or downloaded when performing calls to the host.  

**totalstorage** | bytes  
The total amount of storage capacity on the host. It should be noted that the host can lie.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
**unlockhash** | hash
=======
**unlockhash** | hash  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
The unlock hash is the address at which the host can be paid when forming file contracts.  

**windowsize** | blocks  
The storage proof window is the number of blocks that the host has to get a storage proof onto the blockchain. The window size is the minimum size of window that the host will accept in a file contract.  

**collateral** | hastings / byte / block  
The maximum amount of money that the host will put up as collateral for storage that is contracted by the renter.  

**maxcollateral** | hastings  
The maximum amount of collateral that the host will put into a single file contract.  

**contractprice** | hastings  
The price that a renter has to pay to create a contract with the host. The payment is intended to cover transaction fees for the file contract revision and the storage proof that the host will be submitting to the blockchain.  

**downloadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when downloading data from the host.  

**storageprice** | hastings / byte / block  
The price that a renter has to pay to store files with the host.  

**uploadbandwidthprice** | hastings / byte  
The price that a renter has to pay when uploading data to the host.  

**revisionnumber** | int 
The revision number indicates to the renter what iteration of settings the host is currently at. Settings are generally signed. If the renter has multiple conflicting copies of settings from the host, the renter can expect the one with the higher revision number to be more recent.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
**version** | string
=======
**version** | string  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
The version of external settings being used. This field helps coordinate updates while preserving compatibility with older nodes.  

#### financialmetrics  
The financial status of the host.  
  
<<<<<<< HEAD
**contractcount** | int
=======
**contractcount** | int  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Number of open file contracts.  

**contractcompensation** | hastings  
The amount of money that renters have given to the host to pay for file contracts. The host is required to submit a file contract revision and a storage proof for every file contract that gets created, and the renter pays for the miner fees on  these objects.  

**potentialcontractcompensation** | hastings  
The amount of money that renters have given to the host to pay for file contracts which have not been confirmed yet. The potential compensation becomes compensation after the storage proof is submitted.  

**lockedstoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of storage collateral which the host has tied up in file contracts. The host has to commit collateral to a file contract even if there is no storage, but the locked collateral will be returned even if the host does not submit a storage proof - the collateral is not at risk, it is merely set aside so that it can be put at risk later.  

**lostrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of revenue, including storage revenue and bandwidth revenue, that has been lost due to failed file contracts and failed storage proofs.  

**loststoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of collateral that was put up to protect data which has been lost due to failed file contracts and missed storage proofs.  

**potentialstoragerevenue** | hastings  
The amount of revenue that the host stands to earn if all storage proofs are submitted corectly and in time.  

**riskedstoragecollateral** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has risked on file contracts. If the host starts missing storage proofs, the host can forfeit up to this many coins. In the event of a missed storage proof, locked storage collateral gets returned, but risked storage collateral does not get returned.  

**storagerevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has earned from storing data. This money has been locked down by successful storage proofs.  

**transactionfeeexpenses** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has spent on transaction fees when submitting host announcements, file contract revisions, and storage proofs.  

**downloadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has made from renters downloading their files. This money has been locked in by successsful storage proofs.  

**potentialdownloadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host stands to make from renters that downloaded their files. The host will only realize this revenue if the host successfully submits storage proofs for the related file contracts.  

**potentialuploadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host stands to make from renters that uploaded files. The host will only realize this revenue if the host successfully submits storage proofs for the related file contracts.  

**uploadbandwidthrevenue** | hastings  
The amount of money that the host has made from renters uploading their files. This money has been locked in by successful storage proofs.  

#### internalsettings  
The settings of the host. Most interactions between the user and the host occur by changing the internal settings.  

**acceptingcontracts** | boolean  
When set to true, the host will accept new file contracts if the terms are reasonable. When set to false, the host will not accept new file contracts at all.  

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
The maximum size of a single download request from a renter. Each download request has multiple round trips of communication that exchange money. Larger batch sizes mean fewer round trips, but more financial risk for the host - the renter can get a free batch when downloading by refusing to provide a signature.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to add.  

**size** | bytes  
Initial capacity of the storage folder. This value isn't validated so it is possible to set the capacity of the storage folder greater than the capacity of the disk. Do not do this.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/folders/remove [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "path=foo/bar&force=false" "localhost:9980/host/storage/remove"
```

Remove a storage folder from the manager. All sotrage on the folder will be moved to other stoarge folders, meaning that no data will be lost. If the manager is unable to save data, an error will be returned and the operation will be stopped.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**path** | string  
Local path on disk to the storage folder to removed.  

#### OPTIONAL
**force** | boolean  
If `force` is true, the storage folder will be removed even if the data in the storage folder cannot be moved to other storage folders, typically because they don't have sufficient capacity. If `force` is true and the data cannot be moved, data will be lost.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /host/storage/folders/resize [POST]

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "path=foo/bar&newsize=1000000000000" "localhost:9980/host/storage/resize"
```

Grows or shrinks a storage file in the manager. The manager may not check that there is enough space on-disk to support growing the storasge folder, but should gracefully handle running out of space unexpectedly. When shrinking a storage folder, any data in the folder that neeeds to be moved will be placed into other storage folders, meaning that no data will be lost. If the manager is unable to migrate the data, an error will be returned and the operation will be stopped.

**maxdownloadbatchsize** | bytes  
Maximum number of bytes that the host will allow to be requested by a single download request.  

**maxduration** | blocks  
Maximum duration in blocks that a host will allow for a file contract. The host commits to keeping files for the full duration under the threat of facing a large penalty for losing or dropping data before the duration is complete.

There is a block approximately every 10 minutes. e.g. 1 day = 144 blocks  

**maxrevisebatchsize** | bytes  
Maximum size in bytes of a single batch of file contract revisions. Larger batch sizes allow for higher throughput as there is significant communication overhead associated with performing a batch upload.

```
Response is the same as [`/hostdb/active`](#hosts) with the additional of the **scorebreakdown**

**scorebreakdown**  
A set of scores as determined by the renter. Generally, the host's final score is all of the values multiplied together. Modified renters may have additional criteria that they use to judge a host, or may ignore certin criteia. In general, these fields should only be used as a loose guide for the score of a host, as every renter sees the world differently and uses different metrics to evaluate hosts.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
**score** | big int
The overall score for the host. Scores are entriely relative, and are consistent only within the current hostdb. Between different machines, different configurations, and different versions the absolute scores for a given host can be off by many orders of magnitude. When displaying to a human, some form of normalization with respect to the other hosts (for example, divide all scores by the median score of the hosts) is recommended.  

**conversionrate** | float64 
conversionrate is the likelihood that the host will be selected by renters forming contracts.  

**ageadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on how long it has been a host. Older hosts typically have a lower penalty.  

**burnadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to the host based on how much proof-of-burn the host has performed. More burn causes a linear increase in score.  

**collateraladjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on how much collateral the host is offering. More collateral is typically better, though above a point it can be detrimental.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
**durationadjustment** | float64
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the max duration it accepts for file contracts. Typically '1' for hosts with an acceptable max duration, and '0' for hosts that have a max duration which is not long enough.

=======
>>>>>>> siaprime/master
**interactionadjustment** | float64 
The multipler that gets applied to a host based on previous interactions with the host. A high ratio of successful interactions will improve this hosts score, and a high ratio of failed interactions will hurt this hosts score. This adjustment helps account for hosts that are on unstable connections, don't keep their wallets unlocked, ran out of funds, etc.  

**pricesmultiplier** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the host's price. Lower prices are almost always better. Below a certain, very low price, there is no advantage.  

**storageremainingadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on how much storage is remaining for the host. More storage remaining is better, to a point.  

**uptimeadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the uptime percentage of the host. The penalty increases extremely quickly as uptime drops below 90%.  

**versionadjustment** | float64 
The multiplier that gets applied to a host based on the version of Sia that they are running. Versions get penalties if there are known bugs, scaling limitations, performance limitations, etc. Generally, the most recent version is always the one with the highest score.

Lets you enable and disable a filter mode for the hostdb. Currently the two modes supported are `blacklist` mode and `whitelist` mode. In `blacklist` mode, any hosts you identify as being on the `blacklist` will not be used to form contracts. In `whitelist` mode, only the hosts identified as being on the `whitelist` will be used to form contracts. In both modes, hosts that you are blacklisted will be filtered from your hostdb. To enable either mode, set `filtermode` to the desired mode and submit a list of host pubkeys as the corresponding `blacklist` or `whitelist`. To disable either list, the `host` field can be left blank (e.g. empty slice) and the `filtermode` should be set to `disable`.

>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling

**NOTE:** Enabling and disabling a filter mode can result in changes with your current contracts with can result in an increase in contract fee spending. For example, if `blacklist` mode is enabled, any hosts that you currently have contracts with that are also on the provide list of `hosts` will have their contracts replaced with non-blacklisted hosts. When `whitelist` mode is enabled, contracts will be replaced until there are only contracts with whitelisted hosts. Even disabling a filter mode can result in a change in contracts if there are better scoring hosts in your hostdb that were previously being filtered out.

For efficiency the header for work is returned as a raw byte encoding of the header, rather than encoded to JSON.

Blocks are mined by repeatedly changing the nonce of the header, hashing the header's bytes, and comparing the resulting hash to the target. The block with that nonce is valid if the hash is less than the target. If none of the 2^64 possible nonces result in a header with a hash less than the target, call /miner/header [GET] again to get a new block header with a different merkle root. The above process can then be repeated for the new block header.  

The other fields can generally be ignored. The parent block ID field is the hash of the parent block's header. Modifying this field will result in an orphan block. The timestamp is the time at which the block was mined and is set by the Sia Daemon. Modifying this field can result in invalid block. The merkle root is the merkle root of a merkle tree consisting of the timestamp, the miner outputs (one leaf per payout), and the transactions (one leaf per transaction). Modifying this field will result in an invalid block.

Field | Byte range within response | Byte range within header
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
target | [0-32)
header | [32-112)
parent block ID | [32-64) | [0-32)
nonce | [64-72) | [32-40)
timestamp | [72-80) | [40-48)
merkle root | [80-112) | [48-80)

## /miner/header [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -data "<byte-encoded-header>" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:9980/miner"
```

submits a header that has passed the POW.

### Byte Request
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
For efficiency headers are submitted as raw byte encodings of the header in the body of the request, rather than as a query string parameter or path parameter. The request body should contain only the 80 bytes of the encoded header. The encoding is the same encoding used in `/miner/header [GET]` endpoint.

Blocks are mined by repeatedly changing the nonce of the header, hashing the header's bytes, and comparing the resulting hash to the target. The block with that nonce is valid if the hash is less than the target. If none of the 2^64 possible nonces result in a header with a hash less than the target, call /miner/header [GET] again to get a new block header with a different merkle root. The above process can then be repeated for the new block header.  

The other fields can generally be ignored. The parent block ID field is the hash of the parent block's header. Modifying this field will result in an orphan block. The timestamp is the time at which the block was mined and is set by the Sia Daemon. Modifying this field can result in invalid block. The merkle root is the merkle root of a merkle tree consisting of the timestamp, the miner outputs (one leaf per payout), and the transactions (one leaf per transaction).

#### settings  
Settings that control the behavior of the renter.  

#### allowance 
Allowance dictates how much the renter is allowed to spend in a given period. Note that funds are spent on both storage and bandwidth.  

**funds** | hastings  
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Funds determines the number of siacoins that the renter will spend when forming
contracts with hosts. The renter will not allocate more than this amount of
siacoins into the set of contracts each billing period. If the renter spends all
of the funds but then needs to form new contracts, the renter will wait until
either until the user increase the allowance funds, or until a new billing
period is reached. If there are not enough funds to repair all files, then files
may be at risk of getting lost.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**hosts** | int
=======
**hosts** | int  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Hosts sets the number of hosts that will be used to form the allowance. Sia
gains most of its resiliancy from having a large number of hosts. More hosts
will mean both more robustness and higher speeds when using the network, however
will also result in more memory consumption and higher blockchain fees. It is
recommended that the default number of hosts be treated as a minimum, and that
double the default number of default hosts be treated as a maximum.

**period** | blocks  
The period is equivalent to the billing cycle length. The renter will not spend
more than the full balance of its funds every billing period. When the billing
period is over, the contracts will be renewed and the spending will be reset.

**renewwindow** | blocks  
The renew window is how long the user has to renew their contracts. At the end
of the period, all of the contracts expire. The contracts need to be renewewd
before they expire, otherwise the user will lose all of their files. The renew
window is the window of time at the end of the period during which the renter
will renew the users contracts. For example, if the renew window is 1 week long,
then during the final week of each period the user will renew their contracts.
If the user is offline for that whole week, the user's data will be lost.

Each billing period begins at the beginning of the renew window for the previous
period. For example, if the period is 12 weeks long and the renew window is 4
weeks long, then the first billing period technically begins at -4 weeks, or 4
weeks before the allowance is created. And the second billing period begins at
week 8, or 8 weeks after the allowance is created. The third billing period will
begin at week 20.

**expectedstorage** | bytes  
Expected storage is the amount of storage that the user expects to keep on the
Sia network. This value is important to calibrate the spending habits of siad.
Because Sia is decentralized, there is no easy way for siad to know what the
real world cost of storage is, nor what the real world price of a siacoin is. To
overcome this deficiency, siad depends on the user for guidance.

If the user has a low allowance and a high amount of expected storage, siad will
more heavily prioritize cheaper hosts, and will also be more comfortable with
hosts that post lower amounts of collateral. If the user has a high allowance
and a low amount of expected storage, siad will prioritize hosts that post more
collateral, as well as giving preference to hosts better overall traits such as
uptime and age.

Even when the user has a large allowance and a low amount of expected storage,
siad will try to optimize for saving money; siad tries to meet the users storage
and bandwidth needs while spending significantly less than the overall allowance.

**expectedupload** | bytes  
Expected upload tells siad how much uploading the user expects to do each month.
If this value is high, siad will more strongly prefer hosts that have a low
upload bandwidth price. If this value is low, siad will focus on other metrics
than upload bandwidth pricing, because even if the host charges a lot for upload
bandwidth, it will not impact the total cost to the user very much.

The user should not consider upload bandwidth used during repairs, siad will
consider repair bandwidth separately.

**expecteddownload** | bytes  
Expected download tells siad how much downloading the user expects to do each
month. If this value is high, siad will more strongly prefer hosts that have a
low download bandwidth price. If this value is low, siad will focus on other
metrics than download bandwidth pricing, because even if the host charges a lot
for downloads, it will not impact the total cost to the user very much.

The user should not consider download bandwidth used during repairs, siad will
consider repair bandwidth separately.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**expectedredundancy** | bytes    
=======
**expectedredundancy** | bytes  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Expected redundancy is used in conjunction with expected storage to determine
the total amount of raw storage that will be stored on hosts. If the expected
storage is 1 TB and the expected redundancy is 3, then the renter will calculate
that the total amount of storage in the user's contracts will be 3 TiB.

This value does not need to be changed from the default unless the user is
manually choosing redundancy settings for their file. If different files are
being given different redundancy settings, then the average of all the
redundancies should be used as the value for expected redundancy, weighted by
how large the files are.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Amount of money allocated for contracts. Funds are spent on both storage and bandwidth.  

**hosts** | int
Number of hosts that contracts will be formed with.  

**period** | blocks  
Duration of contracts formed, in number of blocks.  

**renewwindow** | blocks  
If the current blockheight + the renew window >= the height the contract is scheduled to end, the contract is renewed automatically. Is always nonzero.  
>>>>>>> siaprime/master
=======
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling

**maxuploadspeed** | bytes per second  
MaxUploadSpeed by default is unlimited but can be set by the user to manage bandwidth.  

**maxdownloadspeed** | bytes per second  
MaxDownloadSpeed by default is unlimited but can be set by the user to manage bandwidth.  

<<<<<<< HEAD
**streamcachesize** | int
=======
**streamcachesize** | int  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling

Returns the renter's contracts. Active, passive, and refreshed contracts are returned by default.
Active contracts are contracts that the Renter is currently using to store, upload, and download data.
Passive contracts are contracts that are no longer GoodForUpload but are GoodForRenew. This means the data will continue to be available to be downloaded from.
Refreshed contracts are contracts that ran out of funds and needed to be renewed so more money could be added to the contract with the host. The data reported in these contracts is duplicate data and should not be included in any accounting.
Disabled contracts are contracts that are in the current period that are not being used for uploading as they were replaced instead of renewed.
Expired contracts are contracts not in the current period, where no more data is being stored and excess funds have been released to the renter.
Expired Refreshed contracts are contracts that were refreshed at some point in a previous period. The data reported in these contracts is duplicate data and should not be included in any accounting.
Recoverable contracts are contracts which the contractor is currently trying to recover and which haven't expired yet.

**NOTE:** No spending is double counted anywhere in the contracts, only the data is double counted in the refreshed contracts. For spending totals in the current period, all spending in active, passive, refreshed, and disabled contracts should be counted. For data totals, the data in active and passive contracts is the total uploaded while the data in disabled contracts is wasted uploaded data.

Returns the renter's contracts.  Active contracts are contracts that the Renter is currently using to store, upload, and download data, and are returned by default. Inactive contracts are contracts that are in the current period but are marked as not good for renew, these contracts have the potential to become active again but currently are not storing data.  Expired contracts are contracts not in the current period, where not more data is being stored and excess funds have been released to the renter.

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:9980/renter/download/myfile?httpresp=true"
```

downloads a file to the local filesystem. The call will block until the file has been downloaded.

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
<<<<<<< HEAD
**siapath** | string
=======
**siapath** | string  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED (Either one or the other)
<<<<<<< HEAD
**destination** | string
Location on disk that the file will be downloaded to.  

**httpresp** | boolean
If httresp is true, the data will be written to the http response.

#### OPTIONAL
**async** | boolean
<<<<<<< HEAD
If async is true, the http request will be non blocking. Can't be used with
httpresp. An async download will also set the 'ID' field in the http response
header to a unique identifier for the async download which can be used to
cancel the download with the /renter/download/cancel endpoint.
=======
If async is true, the http request will be non blocking. Can't be used with:  
>>>>>>> siaprime/master

**length** | bytes
Length of the requested data. Has to be <= filesize-offset.  

**offset** | bytes
=======
**destination** | string  
Location on disk that the file will be downloaded to.  

**httpresp** | boolean  
If httresp is true, the data will be written to the http response.

#### OPTIONAL
**async** | boolean  
If async is true, the http request will be non blocking. Can't be used with
httpresp.

**length** | bytes  
Length of the requested data. Has to be <= filesize-offset.  

**offset** | bytes  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Offset relative to the file start from where the download starts.  

### Response

<<<<<<< HEAD
standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Unlike most responses, this response modifies the http response header. The download will set the 'ID' field in the http response header to a unique identifier which can be used to cancel an async download with the /renter/download/cancel endpoint and retrieve a download's info from the download history using the /renter/downloadinfo endpoint. Apart from that the response is a standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
## /renter/download/cancel [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:9980/renter/download/cancel?id=<downloadid>"

```go
{
  "scaninprogress": true // boolean
  "scannedheight" : 1000 // uint64
}
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
**scaninprogress** | boolean
indicates if a scan for recoverable contracts is currently in progress.

**scannedheight** | uint64
=======
**scaninprogress** | boolean  
indicates if a scan for recoverable contracts is currently in progress.

**scannedheight** | uint64  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
indicates the progress of a currently ongoing scan in terms of number of blocks
that have already been scanned.

## /renter/rename/*siapath* [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "newsiapath=myfile2" "localhost:9980/renter/rename/myfile"
```

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
<<<<<<< HEAD
**siapath** | string
=======
**siapath** | string  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**newsiapath** | string 
New location of the file in the renter on the network.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /renter/stream/*siapath* [GET]
> curl example  

> Stream the whole file.  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" "localhost:9980/renter/stream/myfile"
```  
> The file can be streamed partially by using standard partial http requests which means setting the "Range" field in the http header.  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -H "Range: bytes=0-1023" "localhost:9980/renter/stream/myfile"
```

downloads a file using http streaming. This call blocks until the data is received. The streaming endpoint also uses caching internally to prevent siad from re-downloading the same chunk multiple times when only parts of a file are requested at once. This might lead to a substantial increase in ram usage and therefore it is not recommended to stream multiple files in parallel at the moment. This restriction will be removed together with the caching once partial downloads are supported in the future. If you want to stream multiple files you should increase the size of the Renter's `streamcachesize` to at least 2x the number of files you are steaming.

### Path Parameters
#### REQUIRED
<<<<<<< HEAD
**siapath** | string
=======
**siapath** | string  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Path to the file in the renter on the network.

# Wallet

## /wallet [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" "localhost:9980/wallet"
```

Returns basic information about the wallet, such as whether the wallet is locked or unlocked.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "encrypted":  true,   // boolean
  "unlocked":   true,   // boolean
  "rescanning": false,  // boolean

  "confirmedsiacoinbalance":     "123456", // hastings, big int
  "unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins": "0",      // hastings, big int
  "unconfirmedincomingsiacoins": "789",    // hastings, big int

  "siafundbalance":      "1",    // siafunds, big int
  "siacoinclaimbalance": "9001", // hastings, big int

  "dustthreshold": "1234", // hastings / byte, big int
}
```
**encrypted** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet has been encrypted or not. If the wallet has not been encrypted, then no data has been generated at all, and the first time the wallet is unlocked, the password given will be used as the password for encrypting all of the data. 'encrypted' will only be set to false if the wallet has never been unlocked before (the unlocked wallet is still encryped - but the encryption key is in memory).  

**unlocked** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet is currently locked or unlocked. Some calls become unavailable when the wallet is locked.  

**rescanning** | boolean  
Indicates whether the wallet is currently rescanning the blockchain. This will be true for the duration of calls to /unlock, /seeds, /init/seed, and /sweep/seed.  

**confirmedsiacoinbalance** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, available to the wallet as of the most recent block in the blockchain.  

**unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, that are leaving the wallet according to the set of unconfirmed transactions. Often this number appears inflated, because outputs are frequently larger than the number of coins being sent, and there is a refund. These coins are counted as outgoing, and the refund is counted as incoming. The difference in balance can be calculated using 'unconfirmedincomingsiacoins' - 'unconfirmedoutgoingsiacoins'  

**unconfirmedincomingsiacoins** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, are entering the wallet according to the set of unconfirmed transactions. This number is often inflated by outgoing siacoins, because outputs are frequently larger than the amount being sent. The refund will be included in the unconfirmed incoming siacoins balance.  

**siafundbalance** | big int  
Number of siafunds available to the wallet as of the most recent block in the blockchain.  

**siacoinclaimbalance** | hastings, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings, that can be claimed from the siafunds as of the most recent block. Because the claim balance increases every time a file contract is created, it is possible that the balance will increase before any claim transaction is confirmed.  

**dustthreshold** | hastings / byte, big int  
Number of siacoins, in hastings per byte, below which a transaction output cannot be used because the wallet considers it a dust output.  

## /wallet/033x [POST]

**address** | hash  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Wallet address that can receive siacoins or siafunds. Addresses are 76 character long hex strings.  

## /wallet/addresses [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" "localhost:9980/wallet/addresses"
```

Fetches the list of addresses from the wallet. If the wallet has not been created or unlocked, no addresses will be returned. After the wallet is unlocked, this call will continue to return its addresses even after the wallet is locked again.

### JSON Response

**addresses**  
=======
**addresses** | []hash  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Array of wallet addresses owned by the wallet.  

## /wallet/seedaddrs [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" "localhost:9980/wallet/seedaddrs"
```

Fetches addresses generated by the wallet in reverse order. The last address
generated by the wallet will be the first returned. This also means that
addresses which weren't generated using the wallet's seed can't be retrieved
with this endpoint.

### Query String Parameters
#### OPTIONAL
**count**  
Number of addresses that should be returned. If count is not specified or if
count is bigger than the number of addresses generated by the wallet, all
addresses will be returned.

## /wallet/backup [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:9980/wallet/backup?destination=/home/wallet-settings.backup"
```

Creates a backup of the wallet settings file. Though this can easily be done manually, the settings file is often in an unknown or difficult to find location. The /wallet/backup call can spare users the trouble of needing to find their wallet file.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**destination**  
Path to the location on disk where the backup file will be saved.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/changepassword [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> -X POST "localhost:9980/wallet/changepassword?encryptionpassword=<currentpassword>&newpassword=<newpassword>"
```

Changes the wallet's encryption key.  

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
<<<<<<< HEAD
**encryptionpassword** | string
encryptionpassword is the wallet's current encryption password.  

**newpassword** | string
=======
**encryptionpassword** | string  
encryptionpassword is the wallet's current encryption password or primary seed.  

**newpassword** | string  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
newpassword is the new password for the wallet.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/init [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "encryptionpassword=<password>&force=false" "localhost:9980/wallet/init"
```

Initializes the wallet. After the wallet has been initialized once, it does not need to be initialized again, and future calls to /wallet/init will return an error. The encryption password is provided by the api call. If the password is blank, then the password will be set to the same as the seed.

### Query String Parameters
#### OPTIONAL WALLET PARAMETERS
<<<<<<< HEAD
**encryptionpassword** | string
=======
**encryptionpassword** | string  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Password that will be used to encrypt the wallet. All subsequent calls should use this password. If left blank, the seed that gets returned will also be the encryption password.  

**dictionary** | string  
Name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding the seed. 'english' is the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

**force** | boolean  
When set to true /wallet/init will Reset the wallet if one exists instead of returning an error. This allows API callers to reinitialize a new wallet.

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example
 
```go
{
  "primaryseed": "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello"
}
```
**primaryseed**  
Wallet seed used to generate addresses that the wallet is able to spend.  

## /wallet/init/seed [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "seed=<seed>&encryptionpassword=<password>&force=false" "localhost:9980/wallet/init/seed"
```

Initializes the wallet using a preexisting seed. After the wallet has been initialized once, it does not need to be initialized again, and future calls to /wallet/init/seed will return an error. The encryption password is provided by the api call. If the password is blank, then the password will be set to the same as the seed. Note that loading a preexisting seed requires scanning the blockchain to determine how many keys have been generated from the seed. For this reason, /wallet/init/seed can only be called if the blockchain is synced.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED WALLET PARAMETERS
<<<<<<< HEAD
**seed** | string
=======
**seed** | string  
>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Dictionary-encoded phrase that corresponds to the seed being used to initialize the wallet.  

#### OPTIONAL
[Optional Wallet Parameters](#optional-wallet-parameters)

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/seed [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "seed=<seed>" "localhost:9980/wallet/seed"
```

Gives the wallet a seed to track when looking for incoming transactions. The wallet will be able to spend outputs related to addresses created by the seed. The seed is added as an auxiliary seed, and does not replace the primary seed. Only the primary seed will be used for generating new addresses.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
[Required Wallet Parameters](#required-wallet-parameters)

#### OPTIONAL | string
[Optional Wallet Parameters](#optional-wallet-parameters)

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/seeds [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> "localhost:9980/wallet/seeds"
```

Returns the list of seeds in use by the wallet. The primary seed is the only seed that gets used to generate new addresses. This call is unavailable when the wallet is locked.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**dictionary** | string 
Name of the dictionary that should be used when encoding the seed. 'english' is the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

### JSON Response
> JSON Response Example

```go
{
  "primaryseed":        "hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello world hello",

curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "encryptionpassword=<password>&keyfiles=/file1,/home/file2" "localhost:9980/wallet/siagkey"
```

Loads a key into the wallet that was generated by siag. Most siafunds are currently in addresses created by siag.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**encryptionpassword**  
Key that is used to encrypt the siag key when it is imported to the wallet.  

**keyfiles**  
List of filepaths that point to the keyfiles that make up the siag key. There should be at least one keyfile per required signature. The filenames need to be commna separated (no spaces), which means filepaths that contain a comma are not allowed.  

### Response

standard success or error response. See [standard responses](#standard-responses).

## /wallet/sign [POST]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" -u "":<apipassword> --data "<requestbody>" "localhost:9980/wallet/sign"
```

Signs a transaction. The wallet will attempt to sign each input specified. The transaction's TransactionSignatures should be complete except for the Signature field. If `tosign` is provided, the wallet will attempt to fill in signatures for each TransactionSignature specified. If `tosign` is not provided, the wallet will add signatures for every TransactionSignature that it has keys for.

>>>>>>> Sia/contract-not-found-handling
Dictionary-encoded phrase that corresponds to the seed being added to the wallet.  

#### OPTIONAL
**dictionary** | string  
Name of the dictionary that should be used when decoding the seed. 'english' is the most common choice when picking a dictionary.  

### JSON Response
 > JSON  Response Example
```go

      }
    ]
  }
}
```
**transaction**  
Raw transaction. The rest of the fields in the resposne are determined from this raw transaction. It is left undocumented here as the processed transaction (the rest of the fields in this object) are usually what is desired.  

See types.Transaction in https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/blob/master/types/transactions.go  

**transactionid**  
ID of the transaction from which the wallet transaction was derived.  

**confirmationheight**  
Block height at which the transaction was confirmed. If the transaction is unconfirmed the height will be the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer.  

**confirmationtimestamp**  
Time, in unix time, at which a transaction was confirmed. If the transaction is unconfirmed the timestamp will be the max value of an unsigned 64-bit integer.  

**inputs**  
Array of processed inputs detailing the inputs to the transaction.  

**parentid**  
The id of the output being spent.  

**fundtype**  
Type of fund represented by the input. Possible values are 'siacoin input' and 'siafund input'.  

**walletaddress** | Boolean  
true if the address is owned by the wallet.  

**relatedaddress**  
Address that is affected. For inputs (outgoing money), the related address is usually not important because the wallet arbitrarily selects which addresses will fund a transaction.  

**value** | hastings or siafunds, depending on fundtype, big int  
Amount of funds that have been moved in the input.  

**outputs**  
Array of processed outputs detailing the outputs of the transaction. Outputs related to file contracts are excluded.  

**id**  
The id of the output that was created.  

**fundtype**  
Type of fund is represented by the output. Possible values are 'siacoin output', 'siafund output', 'claim output', and 'miner payout'. Siacoin outputs and claim outputs both relate to siacoins.  

Siafund outputs relate to siafunds.  

Miner payouts point to siacoins that have been spent on a miner payout. Because the destination of the miner payout is determined by the block and not the transaction, the data 'maturityheight', 'walletaddress', and 'relatedaddress' areleft blank.  

**maturityheight**  
Block height the output becomes available to be spent. Siacoin outputs and siafund outputs mature immediately - their maturity height will always be the confirmation height of the transaction. Claim outputs cannot be spent until they have had 144 confirmations, thus the maturity height of a claim output will always be 144 larger than the confirmation height of the transaction.  

**walletaddress** | boolean  
true if the address is owned by the wallet.  

**relatedaddress**  
Address that is affected. For outputs (incoming money), the related address field can be used to determine who has sent money to the wallet.  

**value** | hastings or siafunds, depending on fundtype, big int  
Amount of funds that have been moved in the output.  

## /wallet/transactions [GET]
> curl example  

```go
curl -A "Sia-Agent" "localhost:9980/wallet/transactions"
```

Returns a list of transactions related to the wallet in chronological order.

### Query String Parameters
#### REQUIRED
**startheight** | block height  
// Height of the block where transaction history should begin.

**endheight** | block height  
Height of of the block where the transaction history should end. If 'endheight' is greater than the current height, or if it is '-1', all transactions up to and including the most recent block will be provided.

### JSON Response
