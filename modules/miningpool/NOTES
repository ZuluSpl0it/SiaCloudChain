When a new connection is made, a new Session is created within a goroutine.
The Session has a unique ID, generated by a function from the Pool - p.newStratumID()
This ID is generated by atomically incrementing the Pool's stratum ID (this pool stratum ID is global with respect to the pool).
The Pool's stratum ID was initially generated by randomly initializing 64 bits.
The extraNonce1 within that session is generated by incrementing the pool's stratum ID again, truncating to 32 bits, and ANDing with 32 bits of 1.
The initialDifficulty of the session is specified as 6. The lastVardiffRetarget time and lastVardiffTimestamp time are both specified as time.now() - session connection time. The session's vardiff is initialized according to newVardiff()

Each Session has an associated Client (upon authorization). A Client can have multiple sessions. The Client is stored in the DB and also in memory when needed.
Each Session also has a Worker associated with it. The Worker is stored in the db while the Session is open, and deleted when the Session is closed.
