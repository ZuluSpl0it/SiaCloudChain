package renter

// worker.go defines a worker with a work loop. Each worker is connected to a
// single host, and the work loop will listen for jobs and then perform them.
//
// The worker has a set of jobs that it is capable of performing. The standard
// functions for a job are Queue, Kill, and Perform. Queue will add a job to the
// queue of work of that type. Kill will empty the queue and close out any work
// that will not be completed. Perform will grab a job from the queue if one
// exists and complete that piece of work. See workerfetchbackups.go for a clean
// example.
//
// The worker has an ephemeral account on the host. It can use this account to
// pay for downloads and uploads. In order to ensure the account's balance does
// not run out, it maintains a balance target by refilling it when necessary.
//
// TODO: A single session should be added to the worker that gets maintained
// within the work loop. All jobs performed by the worker will use the worker's
// single session.
//
// TODO: The upload and download code needs to be moved into properly separated
// subsystems.
//
// TODO: Need to write testing around the kill functions in the worker, to clean
// up any queued jobs after a worker has been killed.
