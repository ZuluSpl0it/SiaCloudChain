// worker.go defines a worker with a work loop. Each worker is connected to a
// single host, and the work loop will listen for jobs and then perform them.
//
// The worker has a set of jobs that it is capable of performing. The standard
// functions for a job are Queue, Kill, and Perform. Queue will add a job to the
// queue of work of that type. Kill will empty the queue and close out any work
// that will not be completed. Perform will grab a job from the queue if one
// exists and complete that piece of work. See snapshotworkerfetchbackups.go for
// a clean example.

// TODO: A single session should be added to the worker that gets maintained
// within the work loop. All jobs performed by the worker will use the worker's
// single session.
//
// TODO: The upload and download code needs to be moved into properly separated
// subsystems.
//
// TODO: Need to write testing around the kill functions in the worker, to clean
// up any queued jobs after a worker has been killed.

// A worker listens for work on a certain host.

// The mutex of the worker only protects the 'unprocessedChunks' and the
// 'standbyChunks' fields of the worker. The rest of the fields are only
// interacted with exclusively by the primary worker thread, and only one of
// those ever exists at a time.
//
// The workers have a concept of 'cooldown' for uploads and downloads. If a
// download or upload operation fails, the assumption is that future attempts
// are also likely to fail, because whatever condition resulted in the failure
// will still be present until some time has passed. Without any cooldowns,
// uploading and downloading with flaky hosts in the worker sets has
// substantially reduced overall performance and throughput.
