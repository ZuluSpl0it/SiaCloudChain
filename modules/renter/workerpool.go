// uploading, downloading, and other tasks related to communicating with the
// host. There is one worker per host that the renter has a contract with. This
// includes hosts that have been disabled or otherwise been marked as
// !GoodForRenew or !GoodForUpload. We keep all of these workers so that they
// can be used in emergencies in the event that there seems to be no other way
// to recover data.

// TODO: Currently the repair loop does a lot of fetching and passing of host
// maps and offline maps and goodforrenew maps. All of those objects should be
// cached in the worker pool, which will both improve performance and reduce the
// calling complexity of the functions that currently need to pass this
